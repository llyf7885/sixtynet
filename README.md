# SixtyNet VPS Hosting: Residential IPs, High Performance, Unbeatable Value

You know that feeling when you're shopping for web hosting and everything just feels... expensive? The good ones cost a fortune, and the cheap ones make you wonder if your website will even load tomorrow. Well, here's something that might change your mind about the whole hosting game.

SixtyNet isn't your typical hosting company trying to squeeze every penny out of you while giving you recycled server space. These folks have figured out something interesting: you can actually offer high-performance VPS hosting without charging people like they're buying a small car. And here's the kicker—they've got residential IP VPS options, which is something most hosting companies don't even touch.

Think of it this way. Most hosting providers operate like apartment complexes where everyone shares everything, and the landlord keeps promising upgrades that never come. SixtyNet? They're more like giving you your own dedicated space with actual good hardware, and they're not treating you like just another number on a spreadsheet. Their infrastructure runs on AMD EPYC processors, DDR4 3200MHz memory, and NVMe SSDs. Translation: your website won't be sitting around twiddling its thumbs when visitors show up.

## What Makes SixtyNet Different From The Pack

The hosting industry has this habit of making simple things complicated. SixtyNet takes the opposite approach. They've built their operation around a straightforward idea: developers and small businesses need reliable, fast hosting that doesn't require a business loan.

Their Los Angeles datacenter sits in Coresite LA2 with Any2 peering and optimized routes for China. That's tech-speak for "your website loads fast, even for international visitors." They're also throwing in DDoS protection that handles over 1000Gbps of malicious traffic, which means when the internet trolls come knocking, your site stays up.

Here's where things get interesting. SixtyNet offers something called residential IP VPS hosting. Most people don't know what that is, but if you're managing social media accounts, doing SEO work, running e-commerce operations, or basically anything where having a "regular person's" IP address matters, this is gold. Regular datacenters give you datacenter IPs, which sometimes get flagged or restricted. Residential IPs? They look like they're coming from someone's home internet connection. Way more trustworthy in the eyes of platforms that care about this stuff.

The company's mission statement actually makes sense: "empower every developer to higher performance solutions at lower cost." Not "maximize shareholder value" or "leverage synergistic opportunities." Just make good hosting affordable. Refreshing, right?

If you're currently wrestling with slow loading times or worried about your hosting provider's reliability, now's probably a good time to check out what modern VPS infrastructure can do for you. 👉 [Explore SixtyNet's VPS hosting plans](https://sixtynet.net/aff.php?aff=39) and see the difference quality hardware makes. They've got a 3-day money-back guarantee, so you're not locked into anything if it doesn't work out.

## Breaking Down The Plans: Something For Everyone

Let's talk about what you actually get. SixtyNet organizes their offerings into four main categories, and each one serves different needs. No fluff, no mystery packages that nobody understands—just straightforward options.

### Residential IP VPS: For When Your IP Address Matters

These plans use AT&T Mobility residential IPs. If you're scratching your head wondering why that matters, here's the deal. When you're running operations that interact with social media platforms, doing market research, managing multiple accounts, or working on SEO projects, having a residential IP makes you look like a regular user instead of a data center operation. Platforms trust these IPs more.

Now, there's a trade-off. Because of IP risk control (basically, preventing abuse), ports 80 and 443 are closed on these plans. That means they're not ideal for running traditional web servers, but they're perfect for the use cases I mentioned above.

**Residential-STARTER** gives you 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, 40GB NVMe storage, and 5TB of traffic for $15 monthly or $140 annually. That's 22% off if you pay yearly. Good starting point if you're testing the waters.

**Residential-MICRO** doubles everything: 4 cores, 4GB RAM, 80GB storage, 10TB traffic. Monthly it's $35, or grab the annual plan for $340 (19% savings). This is where most people who know they need residential IPs probably land.

**Residential-MEDIUM** is for more serious operations: 8 cores, 8GB RAM, 160GB storage, 20TB traffic. We're talking $75 monthly or $740 yearly (18% off annual).

**Residential-LARGE** is the big one: 8 cores, 16GB RAM, 320GB storage, 40TB traffic. $155 per month, or $1,540 if you commit for the year (17% discount).

All these residential plans run on 10G premium networking with 12,500-25,000 IOPS, depending on the configuration. That's fast storage performance, for those keeping score.

### Standard VPS Plans: The Traditional Workhorses

The LAX (Los Angeles) datacenter plans are your traditional VPS setups, but with better hardware than you'd typically find at this price point. These include full DDoS protection and have no port restrictions, so you can run standard web applications, WordPress sites, databases, whatever you need.

**LAX-STARTER**: 2 cores, 2GB RAM, 40GB NVMe, 5TB traffic. Twenty bucks a month, or $200 annually. Basic but solid.

**LAX-MICRO**: 4 cores, 4GB RAM, 80GB NVMe, 10TB traffic. $40 monthly, $400 yearly. This is probably the sweet spot for most WordPress sites or small applications.

**LAX-MEDIUM**: 8 cores, 8GB RAM, 160GB NVMe, 20TB traffic. $80 per month or $800 annually. We're getting into serious territory here—multiple sites, larger databases, more concurrent users.

**LAX-LARGE**: 8 cores, 16GB RAM, 320GB NVMe, 40TB traffic. $160 monthly, $1,600 yearly. This handles substantial traffic and demanding applications.

Every LAX plan includes their premium 10G network, DDoS protection, and those impressive IOPS numbers that mean your databases won't be gasping for air.

### Storage-Focused Plans: When You Need Space

Some applications just need tons of storage. Maybe you're archiving data, running a media site, or handling large file operations. The storage plans use RAID 10 configuration, which means your data is mirrored and striped for both redundancy and speed.

**LAX-Storage-500G** gives you 4 cores, 4GB RAM, and 500GB of RAID 10 storage (that's 300GB base plus 200GB free bonus). You get 10TB traffic and 12,500 IOPS. Runs $40 monthly or $400 yearly.

**LAX-Storage-1TB** bumps up to 8 cores, 8GB RAM, and a full terabyte of RAID 10 storage (700GB + 300GB bonus). Traffic allowance increases to 15TB, and you get 25,000 IOPS. $70 per month, or $700 for the year.

If you've been shopping around and noticed how expensive storage-focused VPS plans usually get, you'll appreciate these prices. The RAID 10 setup means even if a drive fails, your data survives. That peace of mind is worth something.

Comparing these plans to competitors, SixtyNet's pricing holds up remarkably well, especially when you factor in the hardware specs and generous traffic allowances. Many providers nickel-and-dime you on bandwidth or force you into multi-year contracts for decent pricing. Here you get substantial discounts just by going annual, and even the monthly rates don't sting.

For anyone running production workloads or planning to scale up, 👉 [check out the complete specifications and real-time availability](https://sixtynet.net/aff.php?aff=39). The control panel makes it easy to upgrade between plans as your needs grow, so you're not stuck rebuilding everything when you outgrow your initial setup.

## The Technical Stuff That Actually Matters

Let's dig into what's under the hood, because this is where hosting companies either deliver or disappoint. SixtyNet runs AMD EPYC processors—these are the same chips powering serious enterprise infrastructure. They're not using bargain-bin hardware and hoping you won't notice.

The memory is DDR4 running at 3200MHz. That's fast RAM, which matters more than people realize. Slow memory creates bottlenecks that make your fancy processor sit around waiting. SixtyNet's setup keeps data flowing smoothly.

Storage is all NVMe SSDs. If you're not familiar, NVMe is significantly faster than traditional SATA SSDs, which are already way faster than spinning hard drives. We're talking about reading and writing data at speeds that make conventional storage look like it's stuck in traffic. The IOPS ratings (12,500 to 25,000 depending on plan) mean these drives can handle tons of simultaneous operations without choking.

Network infrastructure matters too. The 10G premium network isn't just marketing fluff—it's actual 10-gigabit connectivity. Located in Coresite LA2 with Any2 peering, your traffic takes efficient routes to its destination. The China-optimized routing is particularly notable if you have users in Asia, since transpacific connections can be problematic with poorly configured networks.

DDoS protection covering 1000Gbps+ is substantial. Most attacks that take down websites are way smaller than that. SixtyNet's infrastructure can absorb massive traffic floods while keeping your services online. They also handle advanced CC attacks through hardware mitigation, which tackles more sophisticated threats that try to overwhelm specific services rather than just flooding bandwidth.

The 99.9% uptime guarantee sounds like marketing speak, but look at the infrastructure behind it and it makes sense. Redundant systems, quality hardware, proper network configuration—all the boring technical stuff that keeps sites online.

### Control Panel and Operating System Options

SixtyNet uses VirtFusion for their control panel. It's straightforward—you can rebuild your OS, reboot, access the VNC console, manage snapshots, and handle other server tasks without needing to open support tickets for basic operations. That independence matters when you're troubleshooting issues at 2 AM.

OS options include the usual suspects: CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Archlinux, openSUSE, AlmaLinux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, CoreOS, and Windows. You can also upload custom ISOs if you need something specific. That flexibility means you're not locked into whatever template the hosting company decides to support.

For control panels and applications, they support cPanel, CyberPanel, Plesk, Webmin, CWP, Docker, WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, PrestaShop, and over 400 one-click installations. Whether you want fully managed panels or prefer configuring everything yourself, the options are there.

The KVM virtualization they use gives you actual isolation from other customers on the hardware. You're not sharing kernel resources like with some cheaper virtualization methods. Your allocated CPU, RAM, and storage are genuinely yours, not subject to "noisy neighbor" problems where someone else's resource spike slows your VPS.

## What People Actually Say About Using SixtyNet

Customer reviews reveal what matters more than specifications—how the service performs in actual use. Let's see what people are experiencing.

The performance feedback is consistently positive. Multiple users mention instant loading times and noticeable speed improvements compared to previous hosting. One customer specifically credited the "top-notch hardware" for their website's exceptional performance. When you're paying for fast infrastructure, seeing it translate to actual speed matters.

Support quality gets repeated praise. Customers describe the team as "quick, friendly, and incredibly helpful" with 24/7 availability. The ticket system works reliably, though as SixtyNet notes, complex technical issues requiring investigation may take additional time. That's honest—some problems can't be solved instantly, regardless of how fast support responds.

Ease of use surprises people. Building WordPress sites, setting up applications, managing servers—users report these tasks being more straightforward than expected. The intuitive tools and one-click installations remove friction from server management. You don't need to be a systems administrator to get things working.

Uptime reliability stands out in reviews. Businesses report their sites staying online consistently without unexpected downtime. That 99.9% uptime guarantee appears to hold up in practice. Downtime costs money and reputation, so this consistency matters.

The value proposition resonates with customers. Getting dedicated resources, high-performance hardware, and generous bandwidth allocations at these price points provides what users describe as exceptional value. Particularly for residential IP VPS offerings, which typically command premium prices elsewhere, SixtyNet's rates stand out.

Real-world use cases span diverse needs: WordPress sites, e-commerce platforms, development environments, SEO tools, social media management, web scraping operations, and specialized applications requiring residential IPs. The infrastructure handles varied workloads effectively.

One consideration: credit card payments are currently suspended due to fraud prevention measures. Alternative payment methods work fine, but if you specifically need to use a card, that's temporarily unavailable. All affected refunds were processed, so the company handled the situation appropriately, but it's worth noting.

The residential IP plans' closed ports 80 and 443 limit certain use cases, as mentioned earlier. This isn't a flaw—it's an intentional security measure for residential IPs. But if you need those ports open, you'll want the standard LAX plans instead.

Recent infrastructure upgrades show SixtyNet continues investing in the platform. The AMD 7K62 processors and NVMe SSD upgrades demonstrate ongoing commitment to keeping hardware current rather than letting it stagnate.

Before committing to any hosting provider, seeing how their service performs for your specific needs makes sense. 👉 [Take advantage of SixtyNet's 3-day money-back guarantee](https://sixtynet.net/aff.php?aff=39) to test the infrastructure firsthand. Their setup process is quick, so you can evaluate performance without a major time investment.

## Pricing Breakdown and Money-Saving Options

Let's talk about actual costs and how to get the best value. SixtyNet's pricing structure rewards commitment without locking you into multi-year contracts you'll regret later.

The monthly prices are straightforward—you pay what's listed, no surprise fees or mandatory add-ons. But here's where it gets interesting: their annual billing discounts are substantial.

Choose a 1-year plan and save 17% compared to paying monthly. That's nearly two months free when you do the math. The semi-annual option saves 7%, and quarterly plans trim 10% off the monthly rate. Simple discounts, clearly stated, no games.

Let's run some actual numbers. The **LAX-MICRO** plan costs $40 monthly. That's $480 over a year. Buy the annual plan instead and pay $400—an $80 savings. For the **LAX-LARGE** plan, monthly is $160 ($1,920 annually), but the yearly plan is $1,600. You save $320 just by committing upfront.

The residential IP plans show even steeper discounts since they're specialty services. **Residential-STARTER** is $15 monthly ($180 yearly if paid month-to-month), but the annual plan is only $140. That's 22% off. **Residential-MICRO** jumps from $420 yearly (if paid monthly) to $340 annually—a 19% discount worth $80.

Here's the thing about hosting: if you're serious about your project, you're not pulling the plug after a month anyway. Most people who start a website or application plan to run it for at least a year. Taking the annual discount makes financial sense if you're already committed to the project.

SixtyNet includes several features that other hosts charge extra for. Free daily backups protect your data without additional costs. Free SSL certificates secure your connections without needing to purchase them separately. The DDoS protection is included, not an add-on. These bundled features add real value beyond just the base VPS price.

The 3-day money-back guarantee (note: it's 3 days, not 30 like some providers) gives you a short window to test the service. It's subject to their refund policy terms, so review those if you plan to evaluate the service before committing. The shorter timeframe means you need to test promptly rather than letting it sit.

Comparing to competitors' pricing, SixtyNet positions itself in the value segment without being the absolute cheapest. Rock-bottom hosting usually has catches—oversold resources, ancient hardware, or support that doesn't respond. SixtyNet's pricing reflects quality hardware and actual resource allocation, not "unlimited everything" promises that can't possibly be delivered.

For storage-focused plans, the included bonus storage is clever. The 500GB plan includes 200GB bonus, and the 1TB plan adds 300GB free. That's extra value without complexity.

One cost consideration: alternative payment methods may have different fees depending on your payment processor. Check what payment options work for you since credit cards are temporarily unavailable.

Migration from your current hosting is free, which eliminates a common barrier to switching providers. Moving websites can be technical and time-consuming, so having SixtyNet handle it removes friction.

The pricing structure rewards you for knowing what you need and committing to it. If you're uncertain about resource requirements, starting with a smaller plan makes sense—you can upgrade later. The control panel makes resource adjustments straightforward when your needs change.

## Use Cases: Who Actually Benefits From This Hosting

Different projects need different infrastructure. Let's look at scenarios where SixtyNet's offerings make particular sense.

**WordPress Sites and Blogs**: The LAX-STARTER or LAX-MICRO plans handle most WordPress installations comfortably. The NVMe storage speeds up database queries, which directly impacts page loading. If you're running multiple WordPress sites or expect growth, LAX-MEDIUM provides headroom for expansion. The one-click WordPress installation saves setup time.

**E-commerce Operations**: Online stores need reliability and speed. Cart abandonment increases with every second of loading time. The LAX-MEDIUM or LAX-LARGE plans provide resources for product databases, payment processing, and traffic spikes during sales. The DDoS protection prevents malicious actors from taking your store offline during peak business periods.

**Development and Testing Environments**: Developers need flexibility to install whatever they need, break things, rebuild them, and iterate quickly. The full root access, custom ISO support, and snapshot functionality serve this perfectly. Start with LAX-STARTER or LAX-MICRO for development, then scale up for staging environments that mirror production specs.

**Social Media Management**: This is where residential IP VPS shines. Managing multiple social media accounts, running automation tools, or operating social media marketing platforms often trigger platform restrictions if you're using obvious datacenter IPs. Residential IPs appear as regular users, avoiding flags. The Residential-MICRO or Residential-MEDIUM plans provide resources for typical social media management software while maintaining that crucial residential IP benefit.

**SEO and Market Research**: Collecting search engine data, monitoring competitor rankings, or conducting market research often requires IP diversity and avoiding datacenter detection. Residential IPs let you gather data without triggering anti-bot measures. The generous traffic allowances (5-40TB depending on plan) accommodate substantial data collection operations.

**Web Scraping Projects**: Similar to SEO research, web scraping benefits enormously from residential IPs. Many websites block or limit datacenter IP ranges but allow residential IPs. Ports 80 and 443 being closed isn't an issue here since you're typically making outbound connections, not hosting web services. The bandwidth allocations support large-scale data collection.

**Game Servers**: Small to medium-sized game servers run well on LAX-MEDIUM or LAX-LARGE plans. The low-latency networking and dedicated CPU resources provide smooth gameplay. The DDoS protection matters here—online games are frequent targets for attacks trying to disrupt matches.

**Media and Content Sites**: The storage-focused plans serve media-heavy sites efficiently. If you're hosting video content, image galleries, podcasts, or downloadable files, that RAID 10 storage with generous capacity handles the workload. The 15TB traffic on the 1TB storage plan accommodates substantial content delivery.

**Database Hosting**: Applications requiring dedicated database servers benefit from the compute resources and fast NVMe storage. Database performance relies heavily on storage IOPS, and SixtyNet's 12,500-25,000 IOPS depending on plan provide responsive query execution. The LAX-MEDIUM or LAX-LARGE plans suit most database workloads.

**Small Business Office Applications**: Companies moving office applications to the cloud need reliable infrastructure. Email servers, document storage, CRM systems, and collaboration tools run on LAX plans with appropriate resource allocation based on user count. The uptime guarantee matters for business-critical applications.

The common thread: SixtyNet's infrastructure serves scenarios requiring actual dedicated resources, not shared hosting oversold to hundreds of users. Whether you need residential IPs for specific use cases or just want reliable VPS hosting with quality hardware, the offerings cover substantial ground.

If you're unsure which plan fits your needs, you can always start smaller and scale up. The infrastructure supports growth without forcing you to migrate to entirely different hosting when you outgrow your initial plan. 👉 [Review the detailed specifications for each plan](https://sixtynet.net/aff.php?aff=39) to match resources with your requirements.

## Technical Support and Getting Help When You Need It

Even the best hosting requires occasional support. Let's examine what you can expect when issues arise.

SixtyNet provides 24/7 ticket support included with all plans. That means you can submit issues anytime and expect responses regardless of time zone. The company highlights their quick response times, with 78% of calls answered in seconds and 59-second average live chat waiting times. Those numbers suggest support that's actually staffed rather than token 24/7 availability that really means "we'll get to you eventually."

The 89% satisfaction rating and 76% first-time resolution rate indicate most problems get solved on the first contact. That efficiency matters—nothing is more frustrating than back-and-forth ticket exchanges that never resolve your issue.

Important caveat: tickets requiring investigation, technical troubleshooting, or system adjustments may need additional processing time beyond the typical response window. That's reasonable—complex problems need investigation, not rushed solutions that don't fix anything. The company states this upfront rather than promising instant resolution for everything.

The support team handles various issues across servers, websites, mailboxes, and other services. Whether you're troubleshooting connectivity, debugging application issues, or need assistance with server configuration, the scope covers typical VPS hosting needs.

Free migration assistance removes a common pain point. Moving from another host involves multiple steps—backing up data, transferring files, reconfiguring applications, updating DNS. SixtyNet handles this process without charging migration fees. For busy website owners, having someone else manage the technical details of moving makes switching providers far less daunting.

The knowledge base and FAQ section addresses common questions about infrastructure, available operating systems, virtualization technology, and use cases. If you're the type who prefers self-service solutions before contacting support, those resources provide starting points for common scenarios.

One limitation worth noting: SixtyNet doesn't provide managed services where they handle all server administration. You're responsible for managing your VPS once it's provisioned. If you need fully managed hosting where someone else handles updates, security patches, optimization, and troubleshooting, you'll need to handle that yourself or hire someone. The control panel and one-click installations reduce management burden, but it's still self-managed infrastructure at its core.

For experienced users who want control over their environment, self-managed VPS is ideal. For complete beginners expecting hosting that runs itself, there's a learning curve. The good news: the support team helps with platform-specific issues even if they don't manage your applications directly.

The ticket system works through their client area, maintaining organized communication history. That documentation helps if you need to reference previous interactions or escalate persistent issues.

Response times during critical outages or security incidents matter most. While the company doesn't publish specific SLAs beyond the 99.9% uptime guarantee, customer reviews suggest responsive handling of urgent problems. That practical reliability often matters more than theoretical SLA commitments that companies sometimes weasel out of through technicalities.

## Making The Decision: Is SixtyNet Right For You?

Let's bring this together. You've got options in the hosting world, and choosing wrong costs time and money. So who should actually consider SixtyNet?

If you're running projects that need residential IPs—social media management, SEO tools, market research, web scraping—SixtyNet's residential VPS plans fill a niche many providers ignore. The pricing is competitive for residential IP services, which typically command premium rates elsewhere.

For developers and small businesses wanting quality VPS hosting without premium pricing, the LAX datacenter plans deliver. The AMD EPYC processors, NVMe storage, and generous bandwidth allocations provide infrastructure that handles real workloads, not just marketing claims about "unlimited resources" that never deliver.

Storage-heavy projects benefit from the dedicated storage plans with RAID 10 redundancy. That data protection isn't optional—it's essential when you're storing important files or media content.

The infrastructure particularly suits users who:
- Value performance from quality hardware
- Need dedicated resources rather than shared hosting overselling
- Want transparent pricing without hidden fees
- Require residential IPs for specific use cases
- Run applications needing low-latency networking
- Need DDoS protection without paying extra
- Prefer self-management with support available when needed
- Want flexibility in operating systems and control panels

SixtyNet may not be ideal if you:
- Need fully managed services handling all server administration
- Require credit card payment (temporarily unavailable)
- Want the absolute cheapest hosting regardless of quality
- Need immediate 24/7 phone support (they use tickets)
- Expect ports 80/443 open on residential IP plans
- Need datacenters in multiple global regions (currently Los Angeles only)

The 3-day money-back guarantee provides a testing window, though it's shorter than the 30-day guarantees some competitors offer. That compressed timeframe means you need to evaluate the service promptly.

Comparing value: the combination of hardware specs, bandwidth allocations, included features like DDoS protection and backups, plus the annual discount pricing creates solid value in the VPS market. You're getting actual resources from quality infrastructure, not hoping you won't notice oversold hosting.

The company's positioning as a newer player in the hosting space means they lack the long track record of established providers. However, their infrastructure choices and customer feedback suggest they're building something sustainable rather than trying to cash in on cheap hosting and vanish.

For most use cases requiring VPS hosting, SixtyNet delivers what they promise: high-performance infrastructure at competitive prices. The residential IP options expand that to scenarios where traditional hosting simply doesn't work.

If you're currently dealing with slow hosting, worried about reliability, or need residential IPs for your projects, 👉 [explore SixtyNet's current offerings](https://sixtynet.net/aff.php?aff=39) to see if the infrastructure matches your requirements. The straightforward pricing and technical specifications make it easy to evaluate whether the resources fit your needs without parsing marketing double-speak.

## Wrapping This Up

Hosting shouldn't be complicated. You need reliable infrastructure that performs well without costing a fortune. SixtyNet's approach—quality hardware, transparent pricing, diverse plan options including residential IPs—addresses real needs in the hosting market.

The AMD EPYC processors, NVMe storage, and 10G networking provide a solid foundation. The residential IP VPS options fill a gap many providers ignore. The annual discounts reward commitment without absurd multi-year contracts. Free migration, included backups, and bundled DDoS protection add value beyond just the base VPS.

Perfect? No hosting provider is. The 3-day guarantee is shorter than some competitors. Credit cards are temporarily unavailable. They're currently single-datacenter, limiting geographic diversity. Support is ticket-based rather than phone-centric.

But for developers, small businesses, digital entrepreneurs, and anyone needing quality VPS hosting without premium pricing, SixtyNet deserves consideration. Their infrastructure choices suggest longevity rather than a race to the bottom on price while sacrificing everything else.

Whether you're launching a new project, outgrowing current hosting, or need residential IPs for specialized use cases, the options are there. The 99.9% uptime guarantee, 24/7 support, and real customer reviews backing the claims suggest reliable service rather than empty promises.

Web hosting ultimately comes down to whether the infrastructure serves your needs reliably. The specifications are there, the pricing is transparent, and the platform provides flexibility for various workloads. Sometimes that's enough—you don't need revolutionary, just something that works well consistently. That seems to be what SixtyNet delivers.
